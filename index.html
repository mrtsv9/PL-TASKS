        <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
            printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <b>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                essentially unchanged.</b> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
            like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
        <font color="blue">
        <p> There are many variations of <strong>passages</strong> of Lorem Ipsum available, but the <strong>majority</strong> have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
            even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem
            Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. <b>It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
                words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.</b> The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
